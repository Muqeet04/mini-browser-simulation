# 🧭 Mini Browser Simulation (C++)

A simple **console-based browser simulator** built using **C++**, demonstrating fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** such as **Stacks** and **Doubly Linked Lists**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Open new browser tabs  
✅ Switch between tabs (Next / Previous)  
✅ Close current tab and save it to browsing history  
✅ View all open tabs (with active tab indicator)  
✅ View browsing history (most recent first)  
✅ Clear browsing history  
✅ Menu-driven interface for smooth user interaction

## 🧠 Data Structures Used

| Data Structure | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **Doubly Linked List** | To manage open tabs and navigate between them |
| **Stack (Linked List Implementation)** | To store closed tab history (LIFO order) |

1. Open new tab
2. Close current tab
3. Go to next tab
4. Go to previous tab
5. View all open tabs
6. View history
7. Clear history
0. Exit

   
==========================

Enter your choice: 1

Enter site name to open: YouTube

Opened and switched to tab: YouTube
